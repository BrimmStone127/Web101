                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I was born and raised in Wooster Ohio, about 45 minutes south of Cleveland. After graduating from Dalton High I moved to Rochester to study Web and Mobile Computing. I have been living in Rochester for 3 years besides a summer internship in Albany NY. I have always loved technology and many of my passions are centered around it. Outside of technology I enjoy getting to spend time in the outdoors hiking, fishing, and kayaking. Once I moved into my own apartment I found that I needed to learn to cook, since then I have become obsessed with cooking and am always keen to try new things. Some of my other favorite activities involve: consuming microbrews (I'm 21) some of my favorites are Lord Hobo: Hobo Life, Great Lakes Brewery: Edmund Fitzgerald, and Stone Brewery: Tangerine Express, I also enjoy reading (specifically non-fiction and sci-fi), I also love to watch classic monster movies with my girlfriend (the classic godzilla movies are the best).</p>
