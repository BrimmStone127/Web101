            <p>Vannever Bush was very influential scientist in many fields. During World War II he was the head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development where he was an early administrator of the Manhattan project. Bush is known in the computer industry for leading the way into the development of analog computers with his idea of a hypothetical microfilm viewer Memex. The fundamental concepts of Memex would be the foundation to modern hypertext which would lead to the development of the modern World Wide Web.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Doug Englebart was an engineer and scientist best known for his work in HCI. He is known for the creation of the computer mouse and the development of hypertext. He also worked on creating the precursors to graphical user interface and was the presentor of the "Mother Of All Demos" which was a demonstration in 1968 of many fundamental parts of modern computing including: windows, hypertext, graphics, navigation, command input, video conferencing, word processing, and the computer mouse.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Ted Nelson founded project Xanadu with the goal of creating a simple to use interface. While the Xanadu project for the most part is considered vaporware (Software the is announced and explained but never made) it definitely opened minds to the concepts of the Web. Nelson popularized the idea of hypertext in his book Literary Machines. He considered the idea of a "docuverse", where all data would be stored, there would be no deletions, and all information was accessible by a link from anywhere else. He is credited with coining the term hypertext as well as hypermedia.</p>

            <p>Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs are the co-founder of Apple computers. Steve Wozniak is credited with building the original Apple I computer and primarily designing the Apple II, he also is credited with inventing the universal remote. Steve Jobs helped create Apple alongside Wozniak and focused on selling the Apple I computers and focusing on the business end of the company. He became the CEO of Apple and was fundamental in making it the corporation it is today.</p>

            <p>Tim Berners-Lee He proposed an information management system in March 1989, he implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the internet in mid-November the same year. He also is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The first hypertext website was hosted from a NeXT computer at CERN and it contained information on the project and is still visible today.</p>

            <p>Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina are the creators of Mosaic which was the first web browser with a Graphical User Interface. Released in 1993, Mosaic is credited with being one of the most influential tools in popularizing the Web. It allowed users to surf the internet with a interface that allowed the use of a mouse and keyboard alongside a monitor with an active display. Andreessen and Bina went on to create Netscape which was one of the first sites to really start the dotcom race.</p>

            <p>Rob Hartill is the creator of the Apache web server and the Internet Movie Database IMDB. Apache has become one of the top pieces of open-source software for professional grade servers. It allows users to create their own HTTP services and host them from their own systems. IMDB has also become one of the largest compositories of film information.</p>

            <p>Lou Montulli is the programmer known for the creation of Lynx one of the first web browsers and the oldest that is still in use today. Lynx became a valuable tool for the creation of the web due to its low overhead and speed. It is still available to use and is updated regularly. While it does not a GUI it does work through a CLI. It is now used primarily by engineers needing a low overhead for an internet connection.</p>
