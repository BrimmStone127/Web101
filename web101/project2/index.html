        <p>The Internet, possibly the most influential invention of the past 100 years has a profound impact on our everyday lives. While its impact can be seen in almost everything we do, many do not know much of its history or inner-workings. The Internet is a massive system of interconnected computer networks across the globe. The Internet is used for a plethora of technologies including email, peer to peer file sharing, VPNs, Voice over IP (VoIP), Instant Messaging and it is the platform that hosts the World Wide Web.</p>

        <p>The World Wide Web is a collection of files and other web resources that are all uniquely identified using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) these connected web resources are then hosted on servers that are then connected to the internet to be accessed by anyone with a valid connection. These web resources that are accessed on the Internet displays information that is called Hypertext. This is all done thanks to the protocol known as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). Hypertext is written using a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), HTML files are written to display text and images that also have the ability to connect to other HTML files allowing users to instantly view new web pages and information. Once these HTML files are created, put on a server and assigned a URL they are now available to be accessed by users. To do this users must have Web Browsers. Browsers are a type of computer software that can access the Web and take the HTML and any other web resource on the Internet and display them correctly in a readable format. The most popular examples of modern Web Browsers are Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer. The oldest web browser that is still in general use and active development is Lynx. Started in 1992 Lynx is a text based browser that displays the HTML as simple text with no style or images. The first browser with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) that was broadly used was MOSAIC, released in 1993 MOSAIC is credited with popularizing the Web with its easy to view interface that is very similar in what we use today.</p>

        <p>While the Web is a very big part of the Internet there still are many other actions facilitated by the Internet. The main Internet protocol used by the Web is TCP/IP, but the web was not the first technology to use this. Gopher was a protocol designed to share and organize data. It was released in 1991 and while it quickly was replaced with the Web it still is viewed as a fundamental stepping stone into the popularity of the web. Email is a technology used constantly in the business world that works across the Internet. While many email formats work using the World Wide Web there are many formats that use internet protocols not used by the web. The most popular of these being SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) this sends data to other devices using data ports assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISP). Another technology that utilizes the Internet is Telnet which was developed in 1969 and allows users to remotely access files on other computers that are on the same network. In 1995 researchers wanted to create a replacement for TELNET which lacked a robust authentication or confidentiality. They created a protocol called SSH (Secure Shell) SSH is still widely used today as  way to use network services securely even if the network is unsecure. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that like the name suggests is used to transfer files from one computer to another.</p>
