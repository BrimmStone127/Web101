            <p>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, it is the Internet protocol used for displaying webpages. HTTP is what makes the process of requesting and viewing a webpage possible. A server is a machine connected to the network that houses the web resources necessary for a website such as an HTML page. When a client types in a URL they are giving their machine a path to the server. Once the computer has connected to the server the next step is to send a request. Requests are organized into four main verbs; GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Once you connnect to the server your computer will then send a GET request which is a request that will go to a server and get whatever data you are requesting. This request goes to the server and once it sees that request it will return a response. If the request was valid then the response would be the HTML file that will then be displayed on your machine.</p>
